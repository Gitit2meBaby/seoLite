## 🚀 Why This Plugin Exists

After years of dealing with bloated SEO plugins that slow down websites and clutter admin interfaces, I built what I actually wanted: **a lightweight, powerful SEO plugin that just works.**

## ⚡ The Size Difference is Staggering

| Plugin            | Size       | Difference        |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| **WP SEO Plugin** | **414 KB** | ✅ **Baseline**   |
| Yoast SEO         | ~20 MB     | 🐌 **48x larger** |
| RankMath          | ~12 MB     | 🐌 **29x larger** |
| All in One SEO    | ~15 MB     | 🐌 **36x larger** |
| SEOPress          | ~8 MB      | 🐌 **19x larger** |

_Our entire plugin is smaller than most competitors' CSS files._

## 🔧 Configuration

### Global Settings

Set defaults that apply to all pages unless overridden:

- Site-wide meta tags
- Default social images
- Analytics tracking codes
- Schema organisation details

### Page-Specific Overrides

Customize SEO for individual pages:

- Unique titles and descriptions
- Custom social media content
- Page-specific schema markup
- Targeted tracking codes

### Smart Inheritance

The plugin uses cascading settings (like SCSS):
Throughout I have stuck with modules to avoid specificity issues related to broad selectors over a variety of themes.

- **Global settings** provide defaults
- **Page-specific settings** override globals
- **Visual indicators** show what's inherited vs. custom

## 🎯 Use Cases

### ✅ Perfect For:

- **Performance-focused websites** that can't afford 20MB plugins
- **Developers** who want clean, maintainable (and changeable) SEO code
- **Content creators** who need SEO tools where they work
- **Modern WordPress sites** that value clean admin interfaces
- **Anyone frustrated** with bloated SEO plugins

### ❌ Not For:

- Users who want 100+ features they'll never use
- Sites that require extensive SEO automation
- Users who do not want to type anything...
